1. checkout the changes to update-medications table and subsequently change the associated code to match the suggested schema this is after a successful migration.
2. upon success we are to implement notification feature. let's start with medication feature notifications. our app is to send notifications at the start of each day let it be at 6am though the user is to select a time each day for a comprehensive reminder of the day's pending medications in the settings, an additional reminder is to be sent 10 min before and 10 min after . 
for 10 min after; we are to send notification in the case a user hasn't clicked the take now button 10 min after the due time. we then send a notification. if the user takes the due medication within a 30 min window after the due time, mark was on time to be true for medication log entry. Past a 30 min mark this entry will have a false "was on time". Logging will be done upon clicking of the button or by default 30min
for testing purposes however have an alternative line with a timescale of 5s prior notification, 5s after notification which i'll remove myself after testing.
The user is to be able to select being reminded 5 min after the medication is past. these are to be  boolean fields stored in the medication table so make changes to the sql file before migrating, that is; comprehensive medication reminder at the start of the day, notifications 10 min before, notifications 30 min after. Implement this feature in the profile settings. these notifications are to be set to true by default. 
instead of storing in medication's table, we'll have the settings stored in a new table, medication_preferences.

Perfect ‚Äî here‚Äôs your **revised and polished prompt**, rewritten to reflect all the new details (notification logic, time adjustments, ‚Äúwas on time‚Äù behavior, and new `medication_preferences` table).
It‚Äôs cleaned up, structured for a **coding agent or VS Code task runner**, and ready for practical implementation in your Supabase project.

## üßæ **Prompt: Implement Medication Notification and Preference System**

> **Task Overview:**
>
> 1. Update schema (migrate and refactor code to match new structure).
> 2. Implement the notification feature with before/after logic and time-based tracking.
> 3. Add support for medication preference settings stored in a separate table.

---

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Database Migration ‚Äî Update Medication Schema and Add Preferences Table**

**Goals:**

* Clean up `medications` table (timestamp array for reminders).
* Move notification-related settings to a new `medication_preferences` table.
* Prepare schema for tracking medication logs and ‚Äúon-time‚Äù behavior.

---

#### **A. Modify Existing Table (`medications`)**

```sql
-- Drop unused column
ALTER TABLE public.medications
DROP COLUMN frequency;

-- Change time_of_day to store array of timestamps
ALTER TABLE public.medications
ALTER COLUMN time_of_day TYPE TIMESTAMPTZ[]
USING ARRAY(SELECT unnest(time_of_day)::TIMESTAMPTZ);

-- Add column for tracking if medication was taken
-- ALTER TABLE public.medications
-- ADD COLUMN last_taken_at TIMESTAMPTZ,
-- ADD COLUMN is_taken BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE;
```

---

#### **B. Create New Table (`medication_preferences`)**

This table stores per-user notification settings.

```sql
CREATE TABLE public.medication_preferences (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  user_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES auth.users ON DELETE CASCADE,
  notify_daily_summary BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT TRUE,
  notify_before BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT TRUE,
  notify_after BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT TRUE,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

> **Note:**
> The `notify_before` flag controls the ‚Äú10 min before‚Äù reminder.
> The `notify_after` flag controls the ‚Äú10 min after‚Äù reminder (sent only if medication not marked as taken).

---

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Notification Logic (Supabase Edge Functions + Cron Jobs)**

**Architecture:**
Use **Supabase Edge Functions** as serverless background tasks with **cron triggers**.
No external backend required ‚Äî all logic runs within Supabase.

#### **Functions to Implement**

##### **1. `daily-summary`**

* Runs daily at **6 AM** (or user-selected time from preferences).
* Fetches all medications due that day per user.
* Sends a **comprehensive notification** (email or push) listing pending medications.

##### **2. `reminder-poller`**

* Runs every 5 minutes (cron job).
* Checks `time_of_day` entries in `medications` table against the current time.
* Uses each user‚Äôs `medication_preferences` to determine which reminders to send.

**Behavioral Logic:**

| Condition               | Action                                                                                                                  |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 10 min **before** due   | Send ‚ÄúUpcoming medication‚Äù notification if `notify_before = TRUE`.                                                      |
| 10 min **after** due    | If medication not marked as taken (`is_taken = FALSE`), send ‚ÄúMissed medication‚Äù notification if `notify_after = TRUE`. |
| Taken within 30 min     | Create medication log entry with `was_on_time = TRUE`.                                                                  |
| Taken after 30 min      | Create medication log entry with `was_on_time = FALSE`.                                                                 |
| Not taken within 30 min | Automatically log as missed, with `was_on_time = FALSE`.                                                                |

**Testing Mode:**
Include an alternative timing line using **5-second intervals** (5s before / 5s after) to allow local testing.
This temporary test scale will be removed before deployment.

---

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Logging Behavior**

When a user clicks the ‚ÄúTake Now‚Äù button in the app:

* Update `medications.is_taken = TRUE`
* Set `medications.last_taken_at = NOW()`
* Insert a record into `medication_logs` table:

 
 
* If the medication is taken within 30 minutes of the due time ‚Üí `was_on_time = TRUE`; otherwise `FALSE`.
* If 30 minutes pass with no action ‚Üí log automatically with `was_on_time = FALSE`.

---

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Profile Settings UI**

* Add a new ‚ÄúMedication Notification Preferences‚Äù section.
* Include toggles for:

  * ‚ÄúDaily summary at 6 AM‚Äù
  * ‚ÄúRemind me 10 min before medication‚Äù
  * ‚ÄúRemind me 10 min after missed medication‚Äù
* All toggles default to `true`.
* Save changes to the `medication_preferences` table.

---

### **5Ô∏è‚É£ Supabase Scheduling & Deployment**

1. Create functions:

   * `/supabase/functions/daily-summary/index.ts`
   * `/supabase/functions/reminder-poller/index.ts`
2. Deploy:

   ```bash
   supabase functions deploy daily-summary
   supabase functions deploy reminder-poller
   ```
3. Schedule:

   * `daily-summary`: `0 6 * * *`
   * `reminder-poller`: `*/5 * * *`
